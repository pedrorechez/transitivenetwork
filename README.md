# Project Description
In this project, we plan to build the **Transitive Network**, a layer-2 payment network aiming to congregate the functionality of credit networks (e.g., IOweYou debt links in Ripple) and payment-channel networks (e.g., Lightning Network) without requiring any new token. The Transitive Network will be thereby a complementary scalable blockchain approach with key advantages in terms of performance, economic cost and security and privacy guarantees. The Transitive Network will thus provide Ethereum with a tool to attract the businesses currently associated to Bitcoin and Ripple, first and third cryptocurrencies in the current market capitalization.

# Implementation (prototype)
A prototype implementation of transitive network is available [here](https://github.com/pedrorechez/transitivenetwork). 
The prototype is still in development and not ready for public use.
More details can be found [here](./resources/implementation.md).
