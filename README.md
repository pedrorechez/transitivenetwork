#  Transitive Network Smart Contract 

In this project, we plan to build the **Transitive Network**, a layer-2 payment 
network aiming to congregate the functionality of credit networks (e.g., IOweYou 
debt links in Ripple) and payment-channel networks (e.g., Lightning Network) 
without requiring any new token. The Transitive Network will be thereby a 
complementary scalable blockchain approach with key advantages in terms of 
performance, economic cost and security and privacy guarantees. The Transitive 
Network will thus provide Ethereum with a tool to attract the businesses 
currently associated to Bitcoin and Ripple, first and third cryptocurrencies in 
the current market capitalization.

This repository contains the prototype implementation of the transitive network
in Ethereum using smart contracts. The smart contract is written in solidity.
The prototype uses Truffle for development and testing the smart contracts. This
prototype is not final as it is continually being improved and issues are fixed.

PROTOTYPE. PLEASE DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION.</p>
